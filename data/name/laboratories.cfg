name "zillarl lab" {
	// SyllablesStart denotes the FIRST SYLLABLE of a proper name. Constructed names require both the first 
	// and final syllables, and will precede all other parts of the level title.
	syllablesStart = "Ash, Kai, La, Lah, Mers, Rai, Syr, Tyr, Xan, Zer"

	// SyllablesEnd denotes the FINAL SYLLABLE of a proper name. As stated before, constructed names require
	// both the first and final syllables, and will precede all other parts of the level title.
	syllablesEnd = "a, al, ane, croft, enne, ian, land, na, ny"

	// SyllablesPre denotes the DOMAIN of the level title - that is, things like Genetics, Morphology, and
	// the like. Typically this will be the first word of the level title, but for titles where a proper
	// name was generated, it will come after the name. 
	syllablesPre = "Aerodynamic, Genetic, Hydroponic, Macro, Micro, Morphology"

	// SyllablesPost denotes the FINAL word in a level title.
	syllablesPost = "Control, Laboratory, Research"
  	
	// Finally, the RULES denote how the titles will be constructed. The rules are separated by commas
	// and there is an equal chance for each title construct.
	// For illustration, let's say Start was Ash, End was croft, Pre was Genetic, and Post was Research:
	// $s$e_$20P_$p - "Ashcroft [Genetic] Research"
	// $P$p - "Genetic Research"
	rules = "$s$e_$20P_$p, $P_$p"
