name "zillarl arcane" {
	// SyllablesStart denotes the FIRST SYLLABLE of a proper name. Constructed names require both the first 
	// and final syllables, and will precede all other parts of the level title.
	syllablesStart = "Ash, Kai, La, Lah, Mers, Rai, Syr, Tyr, Xan, Zer"

	// SyllablesEnd denotes the FINAL SYLLABLE of a proper name. As stated before, constructed names require
	// both the first and final syllables, and will precede all other parts of the level title.
	syllablesEnd = "a, al, ane, croft, enne, ian, land, na, ny"

	// SyllablesPre denotes the ADJECTIVE of the level title - that is, things like Crimson, Occult, and
	// the like. Unlike laboratory names, the adjective replaces a generated proper name in the level title.
	syllablesPre = "Crimson, Scarlet, Sapphire, Occult"

	// SyllablesPost denotes the FINAL word in a level title.
	syllablesPost = "Arcanum, Sanctum, Library, Tower"
  	
	// Finally, the RULES denote how the titles will be constructed. The rules are separated by commas
	// and there is an equal chance for each title construct.
	// For illustration, let's say Start was Ash, End was croft, Pre was Crimson, and Post was Tower:
	// $s$e_$p - "Ashcroft Tower"
	// $P$p - "Crimson Tower"
	rules = "$s$e_$p, $P_$p"
