/*
Item data used in the game is read from this CFG file. Item data is kept in structs, which are read into a
dictionary after the libtcod parser runs. The first keyword of the struct - in this case, "item", defines
the struct type, and the string afterward is the struct's name. Each individual item has several distinct
properties:

NAME is a string containing the item's name.
KIND is a string describing the item's type. This type defines the item's category and the glyph it will
	use. This type will also define the equip slot that the item will use, in the case of "suit" and "rune".
COL is a string in the format "RRR,GGG,BBB" which defines a libtcod color for the item's glyph.
DSC is a string containing the item's description.
BLOAT is an integer defining the item's fattening amount. (Food only)
USEEFFECT is a string containing the name of a function. This function is called when the item is used.
	This property can be omitted if the item in question does not have a distinct use.
SLOT is a string defining the equip slot of the item. This value can only be either "suit" or "rune". (Equipment only)
